### **6. Map Expansion System Testing**
1. **Open Developer Console** to monitor expansion
2. **Walk toward any edge** of the initial 100x100 world
3. **Monitor Console for Expansion Trigger**:
   ```
   🔄 Expansion triggered! Distance from edge: XX.X
   📈 Expanding map from 100x100 to 200x200
   ✅ Map expansion complete! Added XX trees, XX treasures, XX crystals
   ```
4. **Verify Seamless Expansion**:
   - No loading screens or gameplay interruption
   - Smooth terrain generation
   - New objects appear in expanded areas
   - Frame rate remains stable (60fps)

### **7. Map Expansion Performance Testing**
1. **Continue exploring** toward edges to trigger multiple expansions
2. **Monitor Performance During Expansion**:
   - Check frame rate in console (should maintain 55+ fps)
   - No significant lag or stuttering
   - Smooth camera movement throughout expansion
3. **Test Maximum Size Limits**:
   - World should expand: 100→200→300→400→500 units
   - Console should show: `🛑 Maximum map size reached` at 500x500
4. **Verify Object Scaling**:
   - Each expansion should add proportional objects
   - Object density should remain consistent across areas

### **8. Enhanced Object Placement Testing**
1. **Verify Smart Placement Logic**:
   - Trees should NOT be placed too close to hills (8+ unit distance)
   - Objects should have natural, varied distribution
   - No overlapping or clustering of major objects
2. **Check Distribution Quality**:
   - Objects spread across entire available area
   - Natural spacing between similar object types
   - Realistic placement avoiding terrain conflicts

### **9. Graphics Quality Scaling Testing**
1. **Open Settings** → **Graphics** 
2. **Test Different Quality Levels**:
   - **Low (256px)**: 2 detail layers, basic models
   - **Medium (512px)**: 3 detail layers, enhanced models  
   - **High (1024px)**: 4 detail layers, full detail models
   - **Ultra**: Maximum detail with all enhancements
3. **Verify Adaptive Scaling**:
   - Tree leaf cluster count varies with quality
   - Crystal formation complexity changes
   - Texture detail adapts appropriately

### **10. Glow Effects & Animation Testing**
1. **Examine Glow Layer Effects**:
   - Crystals should have strong 0.8 intensity glow
   - Treasure chests should have subtle 0.3 intensity glow
   - Multiple glow layers should work simultaneously
2. **Animation System Testing**:
   - Crystal floating animation (up/down movement)
   - Crystal rotation animation (continuous spin)
   - Animations should pause properly when game is paused (Escape)
   - Resume smoothly when game is unpaused

## 🚨 **Critical Camera System Tests (Preserved):**

### **11. Test Head Bob Functionality**
1. **Move with WASD keys** - you should see console messages:
   ```
   Movement state - Moving: true, Running: false, HeadBob: true
   Head bob active - Speed: 8, Intensity: 0.5, Timer: X.XX
   ```
2. **Hold Shift while moving** - look for:
   ```
   Movement state - Moving: true, Running: true, HeadBob: true
   Head bob active - Speed: 12, Intensity: 0.75, Timer: X.XX
   ```
3. **Hold Ctrl while moving** - camera should lower and bob reduce

### **12. Test Pointer Lock (Critical Fix)**
1. **Press Escape** to pause - should see:
   ```
   Pointer unlocked - mouse look disabled
   Game paused
   ```
2. **Press Escape** to resume - should see:
   ```
   Game resumed
   Pointer locked - mouse look enabled
   ```
3. **Repeat 5-10 times rapidly** - NO security errors should appear!
