# üß™ Camera System Test Guide

## üö® **Critical Issues Fixed:**

### ‚úÖ **Issue #1: Head Bob Settings Not Loading**
**Root Cause:** Menu settings object wasn't passing head bob values to the game
**Fix:** Added comprehensive debug logging to track settings flow from menu ‚Üí game

### ‚úÖ **Issue #2: Pointer Lock Security Errors Every Other Time**
**Root Cause:** Rapid pointer lock requests without proper cooldown management
**Fix:** Implemented advanced cooldown system with timing controls

## üéØ **Step-by-Step Testing:**

### **1. Open Game & Check Console**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8001`
2. **Open Developer Console** (F12)
3. Click "Start New Game"
4. **WAIT 3 seconds** for initialization
5. Look for debug messages:
   ```
   [DEBUG] MenuSystem.applySettings called
   [DEBUG] Current menu settings: {headBobEnabled: true, headBobIntensity: 0.5, ...}
   [DEBUG] Sending camera settings to game: {...}
   Updating camera settings with: {headBobEnabled: true, headBobIntensity: 0.5, ...}
   ```

### **2. Test Head Bob Functionality**
1. **Move with WASD keys** - you should see console messages:
   ```
   Movement state - Moving: true, Running: false, HeadBob: true
   Head bob active - Speed: 8, Intensity: 0.5, Timer: X.XX
   ```
2. **Hold Shift while moving** - look for:
   ```
   Movement state - Moving: true, Running: true, HeadBob: true
   Head bob active - Speed: 12, Intensity: 0.75, Timer: X.XX
   ```
3. **Hold Ctrl while moving** - camera should lower and bob reduce

### **3. Test Settings Panel**
1. **Press Escape** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Camera Controls**
2. **Toggle Head Bob OFF** - should see:
   ```
   Updating camera settings with: {headBobEnabled: false}
   ```
3. **Move around** - no more head bob debug messages should appear
4. **Toggle Head Bob ON** and adjust intensity slider
5. **Click Save** and resume game

### **4. Test Pointer Lock (Critical Fix)**
1. **Press Escape** to pause - should see:
   ```
   Pointer unlocked - mouse look disabled
   Game paused
   ```
2. **Press Escape** to resume - should see:
   ```
   Game resumed
   Pointer locked - mouse look enabled
   ```
3. **Repeat 5-10 times rapidly** - NO security errors should appear!
4. If you see `Pointer lock change too rapid, ignoring` - that's GOOD! It means the cooldown is working.

### **5. Verify Camera Effects**
1. **Movement Tilt**: Strafe left/right (A/D) while moving forward - camera should tilt
2. **Crouching**: Hold Ctrl - camera lowers, movement slower, reduced head bob
3. **Running**: Hold Shift - movement faster, enhanced head bob
4. **All effects should be visible and smooth**

## üîç **Debug Console Messages to Look For:**

### **‚úÖ Good Messages (Expected):**
```
[DEBUG] MenuSystem.applySettings called
[DEBUG] Sending camera settings to game: {headBobEnabled: true, ...}
Movement state - Moving: true, Running: false, HeadBob: true
Head bob active - Speed: 8, Intensity: 0.5
Pointer locked - mouse look enabled
Pointer unlocked - mouse look disabled
```

### **‚ùå Bad Messages (Should NOT Appear):**
```
SecurityError: The user has exited the lock before this request was completed
Pointer lock failed (repeatedly)
updateCameraSettings called with undefined headBob values
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Messages (OK to ignore):**
```
Pointer lock change too rapid, ignoring
Pointer lock request failed: [any reason]
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **If Head Bob Still Doesn't Work:**

1. **Check Browser Console** for the exact debug messages
2. **Verify Settings Loading**: Look for `[DEBUG] Current menu settings:` - does it show `headBobEnabled: true`?
3. **Check Game Reception**: Look for `Updating camera settings with:` - does it include head bob settings?
4. **Manual Test**: In Settings ‚Üí Camera Controls, toggle Head Bob off/on and adjust intensity

## üéÆ **Expected Behavior:**

### **Head Bob Effects:**
- **Walking**: Subtle up/down and side-to-side camera movement
- **Running** (Shift): More pronounced bobbing
- **Crouching** (Ctrl): Reduced bobbing, lowered camera

### **Movement Tilt:**
- **Strafing Left** (A): Camera tilts slightly left
- **Strafing Right** (D): Camera tilts slightly right

### **Pointer Lock:**
- **Escape to pause**: Smooth transition, no errors
- **Escape to resume**: Automatic pointer lock re-engagement
- **Rapid toggling**: Cooldown system prevents security errors

## üìä **Performance Notes:**
- Debug logging will slow down the game slightly - this is normal for testing
- Head bob calculations run every frame when moving
- All effects are optimized for smooth 60fps gameplay

**If everything works correctly, you should have a much more immersive camera experience! üöÄ**
