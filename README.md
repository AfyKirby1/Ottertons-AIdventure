## üéÆ **For Developers**

### **Camera System Architecture**
The new `CameraController` component provides:
- **Single Source of Truth**: All camera logic in one dedicated class
- **Perfect Movement Alignment**: Uses Babylon.js transformation matrices for exact direction calculation
- **Zero Conflicts**: Completely disabled built-in camera controls to prevent interference
- **Easy Customization**: Simple methods for sensitivity, invert Y, and effect settings
- **Future-Proof**: Modular design allows easy expansion and modification

### **Key Methods**
```javascript
// Get exact movement directions
const { forward, right } = cameraController.getMovementDirections();

// Update camera settings
cameraController.updateSettings({ sensitivity: 200, headBobEnabled: false });

// Control camera state
cameraController.attachControls();
cameraController.detachControls();
```

### **Expansion Ideas**

#### **For Beginners**
- Add more treasure types with different values
- Create different crystal colors with various effects
- Include environmental storytelling elements
- Add simple puzzle mechanics

#### **For Advanced Developers**
- **NPCs and Dialogue**: Character interactions and storylines
- **Combat System**: Enemies, weapons, and fighting mechanics
- **Crafting System**: Item combination and creation
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Cooperative or competitive gameplay
- **Camera Extensions**: Add new camera effects using the modular system
